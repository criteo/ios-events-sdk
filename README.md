# Criteo Events SDK

Thanks for looking at the Criteo Events SDK! It allows iOS applications to easily send events
back to Criteo to power your targeted campaigns.

## Download

The Criteo Events SDK is available via:

### 1. CocoaPods

The Events SDK is available as a Pod via Cocoapods; to use it, add the following to your build target in your `Podfile`. E.g. :

end

```

Then run 'pod install' in your project directory and open your MyApp.xcworkspace and build

### 2. Cloned GitHub repository

You can obtain the Event SDK source by cloning the git repository and including it into your project manually.
`git clone git://github.com/criteo/ios-events-sdk.git`
