 *  The start or travel checkin date associated with this event.

 *  @discussion
 *  This date components object represents the start or checkin date associated
 *  with an event as it was displayed to the user in your UI. The default value
 *  of this property is @a nil.
 *
 *  The properties of this date components object are interpreted as absolute
 *  values (not quantities). Only the @c year, @c month, and @c day properties
 *  are read from this object.
 *
 *  Instances of NSDateComponents stored into this property must represent valid
 *  dates in the @c NSCalendarIdentifierGregorian calendar. If you attempt to
 *  store an invalid date into this property, the invalid date will be
 *  discarded, and the value of the property will not be changed.
 *
 *  @b Example:
 *
 *  If your user searches for a travel product with a start date of
 *  2015-12-31, you would compose an NSDateComponents object to represent this
 *  date with the following code:
 @code
 NSDateComponents *start = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];

 start.year = 2015;
 start.month = 12;
 start.day = 31;

 event.startDate = start;
 @endcode
 *
 *  @warning
 *  You should only set the year, month, and day properties of the date
 *  components object you assign to this property. Other properties of the date
 *  components object, including @c timeZone, will be ignored when the event is
 *  sent to Criteo.
